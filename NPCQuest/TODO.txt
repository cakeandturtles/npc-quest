NPC Quest: 

TODO::
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Make day/night cycle (reset with World.NewGame()) -> time and day variables
	WORLDCOLORCYCLE instead of room

	-Green is midday, purple is sunset, dark is night, orange is sunrise
	-no watch UI, time doesn't pass when the room is PAUSED
	-after 3-5 days, game over
		-STATS (see npc stuff below)
2. Make town tileset.
3. Speech sequences (for skulls)
4. MORE NPCS!!!!
	-NPCs have moods :) :( >:( :|
		-kiss NPC, kill NPC, give NPC hope, take hope away from NPC, become NPC friend, become enemy
		-quantify emotions...
	-Most importantly, make the dialogue/monologue of the NPCs be personality-filled, but also meaningful. This is a little village of weird creatures 	
		-"This is all I can say.", "We exist to serve a purpose. An objective"
		-"What is the point of me saying this?"
	-e.x.::
		-talkative girl from MOTHER 3, roof guy from Anodyne
2. IMplement saving
