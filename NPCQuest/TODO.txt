NPC Quest: 

TODO::
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. AFTER GETTING THE FIRST SKULL, all the NPCS are moved to different locations in the map
	-have World array that keeps track of all the individual NPCs (sans uh skulls)
3. Speech sequences (for skulls)
4. MORE NPCS!!!!
	-NPCs have moods :) :( >:( :|
		-kiss NPC, kill NPC, give NPC hope, take hope away from NPC, become NPC friend, become enemy
		-quantify emotions...
	-Most importantly, make the dialogue/monologue of the NPCs be personality-filled, but also meaningful. This is a little village of weird creatures 	
		-"This is all I can say.", "We exist to serve a purpose. An objective"
		-"What is the point of me saying this?"
	-e.x.::
		-talkative girl from MOTHER 3, roof guy from Anodyne
		-(I hope when you die you get to see your stats like how many times you laughed or told a lie or kissed or how many people loved you and how many people hated you and what you meant to people)
2. IMplement saving
3. language translations from Txt
